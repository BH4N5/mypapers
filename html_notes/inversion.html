    <h3>Method of inversion</h3>
    <h4><i>19.01.2024</i></h4>

    <p>
        The so called <i>method of images</i> is a well known technique for solving various boundary
        value problems in potential theory (electrostatics, steady-state heat equation). The method
        was first described by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who used it to derive, now standard,
        theorems regarding spherical conductors under the influence of point charges (see the paper
        "On the mathematical theory of electricity in equilibrium" available <a
            href="https://archive.org/details/reprintofpaperso00kelv">here</a>). In the same paper Lord
        Kelvin also introduced another method called <i>method of inversion</i> or
        <i>electrical inversion</i> which he later used to find a solution to a highly non-trivial
        problem of determining a charge distribution on a conducting spherical bowl under the
        influence of a point charge. James Clerk Maxwell in his monumental work "A Treatise on
        Electricity and Magnetism" commented on this result: <i>"One of the most remarkable
            illustrations of the power of Sir W. Thomson's method of Electrical Images is furnished by
            his investigation of the distribution of electricity on a portion of a spherical surface
            bounded by a small circle. [...] I am not aware that a solution of the problem of the
            distribution of electricity on a finite portion of any curved surface has been given by any
            other mathematician."</i>. The purpose of this article is to present the method of
        electrical inversion.
    </p>
    We begin by defining geometrical transformation called <i>inversion in a sphere</i>. Let
    $\Omega=(O, R)$ be a sphere of radius $R$ and centre $O$. We define an <i>inversion with respect
        to $\Omega$</i> as a mapping which transforms any point $P \neq O$ to a point $P'$ on the ray
    $OP$ such that
    $$
    |OP|\cdot|OP'| = R^2\,.
    $$
    Based on this definition one may easily prove the
    following statements.
    <ol>
        <li>
            The image of a sphere or a plane is a sphere or a plane.
        </li>
        <li>
            The image of a sphere $\omega=(A, a)$ which does not pass through the origin $O$ is a
            sphere $\omega' = (B, b)$ where $b = \frac{R^2}{|OA|^2 - a^2}a $ and $B$ is a point
            on the ray $OA$ s.t. $ |OB| = \frac{R^2}{|OA|^2 - a^2}|OA|\,. $
        </li>
        <li>
            For any two points $A, B \neq O$ the length of the segment $A'B'$ is $|A'B'| = |AB|\frac{R^2}{|OA||OB|}$
        </li>
        <li>
            Inversion preserves angles between planes, between spheres and between planes and spheres.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        We can now define a "physical" transformation of a system of point charges which we will call <i>electrical
            inversion</i>. Let us consider a system of point charges $q_1,\ldots,q_n$ placed at points $P_1,\ldots,P_n$.
        Let $O$ (for all $i$ $O \neq P_i$) be a centre of a sphere and let $R$ be its radius. The image of such
        electrical system under an electrical inversion with respect to a sphere $(O, R)$ is a system of charges
        $q_1',\ldots, q_n'$ placed at $P_1', \ldots,P_n'$ where $P_i'$ is an image of $P_i$ under inversion with respect
        to the given sphere and
        $$
        q_i' = q_i\frac{R}{|OP_i|}\,.
        $$
        We will now prove the following theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
        (<b>Kelvin transform theorem</b>) Given a system of charges $S$ and its image $S'$ under electrical inversion
        with
        respect to a sphere $(O, R)$ the value of the potential $\phi(A)$ generated by $S$ at point $A$ is related to
        the value of the potential $\phi'(A')$ generated by $S'$ at point $A'$ (image of $A$ under inversion) by the
        formula
        $$
        \phi(A) = \frac{R}{|OA|}\phi'(A')\,.
        $$
    </p>
    <p>
        The proof is straightforward (for clarity we put $4\pi\epsilon_0 = 1$)
        \begin{align}
        &\phi(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{q_i}{|P_iA|}\\
        &\phi'(A') = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{q_i'}{|P_i'A'|} =\sum_{i=1}^n
        \frac{q_i\frac{R}{|OP_i|}}{|P_iA|\frac{R^2}{|OP_i||OA|}} = \frac{|OA|}{R}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{q_i}{|P_iA|}
        \end{align}
        hence we obtain the result.

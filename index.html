    <!-- <h3>Method of inversion</h3>

    <p>
        The so called <i>method of images</i> is a well known technique for solving various boundary
        value problems in potential theory (electrostatics, steady-state heat equation). The method
        was first described by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who used it to derive, now standard,
        theorems regarding spherical conductors under the influence of point charges (see the paper
        "On the mathematical theory of electricity in equilibrium" available <a
            href="https://archive.org/details/reprintofpaperso00kelv">here</a>). In the same paper Lord
        Kelvin also introduced another method called <i>method of inversion</i> or
        <i>electrical inversion</i> which he later used to find a solution to a highly non-trivial
        problem of determining a charge distribution on a conducting spherical bowl under the
        influence of a point charge. James Clerk Maxwell in his monumental work "A Treatise on
        Electricity and Magnetism" commented on this result: <i>"One of the most remarkable
            illustrations of the power of Sir W. Thomson's method of Electrical Images is furnished by
            his investigation of the distribution of electricity on a portion of a spherical surface
            bounded by a small circle. [...] I am not aware that a solution of the problem of the
            distribution of electricity on a finite portion of any curved surface has been given by any
            other mathematician."</i>. The purpose of this article is to present the method of
        electrical inversion and show its application to some interesting problems in
        electrostatics.
    </p>
    We begin by defining geometrical transformation called <i>inversion in a sphere</i>. Let
    $\Omega=(O, R)$ be a sphere of radius $R$ and centre $O$. We define an <i>inversion with respect
        to $\Omega$</i> as a mapping which transforms any point $P \neq O$ to a point $P'$ on the ray
    $OP$ such that
    $$
    |OP|\cdot|OP'| = R^2\,.
    $$
    Based on this definition one may easily prove the following statements.
    <ul>
        <li>
            The image of any sphere under the inversion is a sphere, except when the sphere passes through the centre of
            inversion then the image is a plane.
        </li>
        <li>
            The image
        </li>
    </ul>
